) ) without writing a Python program or using the Python interpreter, answer the

1. What value is returned by len ( items )?
2. What is the value of items[1]?
3. print items[2][0] prints 1 but print items[3][0] causes a TypeError. Why is
this given that items has more than 3 elements?
4. For items[x][y], what values of x and y cause the expression to evaluating to
9?
5. It might at first appear that the type of items[0] and the type of items[4] are

type of items[4] not tuple? (c) If it was intended that items[4] be a tuple, how
