Examine the following code a = 10 b = 20 print Before swapping a=%d,
b=%d % ( a , b ) #Swap values a=b b=a print After swapping a=%d, b=%d % ( a
, b )


1. Try running this small program. What are the values of a and b after the
swap
2. Why is the result not a having the value 20 and b having the value 10 as
appears to be the intention from the use of the word swap in the code
3. Modify the code so that the final result is a having the value 20 and b having
the value 10 using simultaneous assignment to swap the values.
4. Many languages, such as C, C++, Java, do not have simulta- neous
assignment. Modify the program so that it successfully swaps the two values
without using simultaneous assignment.
5. Both a and b have the value 20.

7. a,b=b,a
8. a = 10 b = 20 print "Before swapping a=%d, b=%d" % (a, b) # Swap values
temp = a a=b b = temp print "After swapping a=%d, b=%d" % (a, b)

Answer:

1.交换值之后 a=20 ,b=20 
2. 代码是先后执行的，先执行a=b ,则b的值20已经赋值给了a,  然后执行b=a, a的值再赋值给b,b的值此刻仍为20

3.代码如下:
a=10 
b=20
temp=a
a=b
b=temp
print("After swapping a=%d, b=%d"% (a,b))

4.没看懂

5.a=b 再打印就行
