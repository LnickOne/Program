Four
score
and
seven
years
ago
our
fathers
brought
forth
upon
this
continent
a
new
nation
conceived
in
liberty
dedicated
to
the
proposition
that
all
men
are
created
equal
Now
we
engaged
great
civil
war
testing
whether
or
any
so
can
long
endure
We
met
on
battlefield
of

come
dedicate
portion
field
as
final
resting
place
for
those
who
here
gave
their
lives
might
live
It
is
altogether
fitting
proper
should
do
But
larger
sense
cannot
consecrate
hallow
ground
